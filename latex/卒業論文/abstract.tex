The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) consists of designing vehicle routes and schedules for multiple users who specify pickup and delivery requests between origins and destination. The aim is to design a set of minimun cost vehicle route while accommodating all requests. Side constraints include vechile capacity, route duration, maximum ride time, etc. DARP arises in share taxi service or transporting people in health care service.

A number of papers about DARP has been published. most of the previous research deal with time windows and maximum ride time as hard constraints.

In this study, we consider with the DARP where time windows and maximum ride time are soft constraints. These soft constraints make the DARP more generic. We propose iterated local search algorithm to find a solution to the problem.
